### Structure for Presenting the Dossier **par projet**

1. **Introduction**
    - TedHy stands as a comprehensive techno-economic planning tool that facilitates strategic decision-making for individual hydrogen projects to large scale supply chain infrastructure. By simulating various options related to technology, dimensioning, timing, and location, TedHy empowers stakeholders to make informed infrastructure choices that position hydrogen projects on a path to success from the earlier planning phases.
    - TedHy help organization dimension and choose optimized supply chain components for their mobility or other hydrogen infrastructure projects. This is done by gather data from the user about the commodities available for the project and the uses that will be consuming H2 and then an algorithm developed by the math team and integrated into the django backend by the dev, data and devops team is used to generate optimized scenarios according to all the inputs gathered from the user, paramteres given by the user and a propriotary technology database. 
    - Explanation of how these projects cover the necessary competencies from the referential: I participated thought out the development of this project through muliple aspects such as: 
	    - (BC04) Collecting business needs from potential clients and actual clients with the assistance of the product owner through interviews to understance the techonoligial feasability the software.
	    - (BC04) Conceive an architechtural plan for the software, in this case its a backend  webservice with other supporting services like, Redis for caching and Celery for asynchronos tasks and a frontend that communicates with the backend though REST API and websockets.  *(Insert diagrams....)*
		- (BC04) Activaly participated in the developlment of the project using my Javascrip and Python languages to contribute to the frontend by create adapted interface and data visualisation charts and graphs.. and to the backend by building along side my team the REST API end points and the Websocket Channels that are consumend on the web frontend. All accoring to the sprint plan and the features specified and documented in the sprint planning. 
		- (BC04) Write fonctional tests for the backend using pytest to insure that the REST API is returning the expected values accoding the correct inputs and paramters. these tests would run automaticaly on the projects GitLab Pipeline before each deployment. *(insert screenshot of tests passing)*
		- (BC04) Contrubuted to the conduite de changement by participating in product launch meetings with clients to inform, communicate, form and make them participate *(expand on this)*
