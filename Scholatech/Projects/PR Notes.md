Now that the cloud setup is much more far ahead than at the start we have;
- CI/CD that builds docker images of our built app and pushes said image to dockerhub, then seemlessly deployes our app.
I would like to start thinking about the next steps, the ideas floating in my head are the following:
- Ask for specs/expectation of prospect school and move features in that direction.
- Create a saas control-plane to allow prospects to try app and offer the app as a saas 
	- Further setup of the cloud-setup: Subdomains, DB managment, DB backup...
	- Expand/Create new control plane app to serve the app saas.
