This project would involve several components:

1. **Data Collection and Storage:** Implement data ingestion from real-time traffic APIs or datasets, store this data in a database (SQL or NoSQL or TimeSeriesDB).
    
2. **Data Processing and Cleaning:** Use Python and Pandas to clean and process the data, preparing it for analysis.
    
3. **Machine Learning Model Development:** Build models to predict traffic patterns, congestion points, or travel times. Start with simpler models and gradually introduce more complexity (e.g., regression models, then moving to neural networks).
    
4. **Model Deployment and Integration:** Deploy the models into a real-time system, possibly using cloud services for scalability.
    
5. **Data Visualization:** Develop a dashboard to visualize real-time traffic data and predictions, integrating your full-stack development skills.
    
6. **Evaluation and Optimization:** Continuously evaluate the model's performance and optimize it for better accuracy and efficiency.
