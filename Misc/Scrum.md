# Scrum Theory
Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from
experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses
on the essentials.

# Scrum Pillars
Transparency, inspection, adaptation.

# Scrum Values
Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage

# Scrum Team
The Scrum Team consists of
one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams
or hierarchies.

# Developers
Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are **committed** to creating any aspect of a usable
Increment each Sprint.
# Scrum Master
The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by
helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the
organization

# Product Owner
The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of
the Scrum Team.

# Scrum Events
The Sprint is a container for all other events.
The Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.

# Daily Scrum
The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is
held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master
are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.

# Scrum Artifacts
● For the **Product Backlog** it is the Product Goal.
● For the **Sprint Backlog** it is the Sprint Goal.
● For the Increment it is the **Definition of Done**.

# Definition of Done
The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality
measures required for the product
